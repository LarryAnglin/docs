__KML Example Export__


Next I'll use the same example, but export to KML. The process is:

1.  Click on Export Visits.
2.  Set the Start and End Dates.
3.  Change the export format to KML.
4.  Click on Export.
5.  Use AirDrop to send it to the Mac.

This file has the same problem as the CSV export, AirDrop insists on saving the file with a .txt extension.  

6.  Change the extension on the file from '.txt' to '.kml'.
7.  Open the file.

If you have Google Earth installed, it will launch and load the file.  

Google Earth shows each of my visits as a push pin. There is only one pin at 801 E Ross. Clicking on it shows when I arrived and when I left.
