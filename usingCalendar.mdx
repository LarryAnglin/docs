__Using the Calendar__

Visitd records the places you visit on your calendar. This section explains the format of each entry on the calendar.

The picture below shows a typical entry created by Visitd:

The fields are explained below.

If the address is available, it is the title. If no address is available, then the latitude and longitude of the location is used.

2.  __Latitude and Longitude__

In decimal degrees.

3.  __Date__

The date of the event.

4.  __Start and End times__

5.  __Start of Event__

6.  __End of Event__

7.  __Title__

8.  __Latitude__

The latitude returned by the GPS in decimal degrees.

9.  __Longitude__

The longitude returned by the GPS in decimal degrees.

10.  __Horizontal Accuracy__

The accuracy of the location in meters.

11.  __URL__

A URL that will display a map of the location with the location in the center.

The data may seem redundant, it is designed to be easily parsed by programs that read events in the ICS format so some information is presented twice - 
once for the user and again to simplify parsing the data.
