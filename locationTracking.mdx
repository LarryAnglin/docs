description: Setting up location tracking permissions for Visitd

<Info>
Visitd needs your permission to track your location. Apple does not allow apps to request background location tracking immediately, 
an app must first request When In Use location tracking. The user will be prompted later to enable background location
tracking.  

See [this article](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102515) on the Apple Support website for more information on location tracking.

Click on __Allow While Using App__ to continue.

__At some point in the future you will be prompted to Always Allow Location Tracking. Please approve that request when it occurs.__
