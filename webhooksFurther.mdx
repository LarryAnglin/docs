# Webhooks Going Further

Once you have a server that can accept data from Visitd, you can do all sorts of things with it. For example, you could:

## 1. Send an email each time you arrive at a customer site.
 
If you know the latitude and longitude of the customer site, you can compare that to the latitude and longitude and horizontal accuracy from Visitd 
to detect a visit to a client. Then you can use a service like [Mailgun](https://try.mailgun.com) to send an email to keep a record of the visit.  
 
## 2. Add a line to a Google spreadsheet
 
You could use Google's API to [add an entry to a Google Spreadsheet](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/get-started).

## 3. Post a Slack message
[Using Slack's API](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks)

Or whatever you can dream up.
