# Release Notes

## Version 0.8

### Release 191
#### May 28, 2024
    
Release 191 has several major improvments over the prior beta release 140. These include:

#### Fix to prevent a crash when updating the database on a background thread.
The only known cause of a crash is when the app is launched by the OS on a background thread in response
to a location update and the app saves data to the database context on a different thread than the context
was created on.

SwiftData introduces an entire new framework for dealing with concurrency issues. Adopting the framework
required extensive modifcations to large sections of the code base.

#### Saving to a shared calendar
Version 140 used a feature of iOS 17 to only write to a user's calender. Without being able to query the calendar
store for a list of calendars, it was not possible to save visits to any calendar other than the user's default
calendar. Many users asked for the ability to save visits to a calendar other than the default, especially to
a shared calendar. The user can now choose any existing calendar to save visits to.

To change the calendar events are saved to, click on the Calendar Name line in the Visit main screen and choose whatever calendar you want. Then click on Save.  
    
Saving to a shared calendar requires a differnt level of permissions. If you see the Calendard Permissions line with a red background, click on it
and select 'Full Access'.

I created a very short video that will walk you through enabling full access to calendars. [View video](http://help.visitd.app/videos)

#### Webhooks - Experimental Feature
I have added the option for Visitd to make an http call whenever you arrive or depart a location. This is a very cool feature, for a very small number of users.  
    
If you understand webhooks, it opens a world of possibilities. If you have an opinion on this feature, I welcome it.
